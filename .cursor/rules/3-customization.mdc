# Flyer Chat - Customization

Flyer Chat offers extensive customization through two primary mechanisms:

## 1. Theming (`ChatTheme`)

- Controls the overall look and feel (colors, typography, shapes).
- Defined in `flutter_chat_core`:
    - [chat_theme.dart](mdc:packages/flutter_chat_core/lib/src/theme/chat_theme.dart)
    - [chat_theme_extension.dart](mdc:packages/flutter_chat_core/lib/src/theme/chat_theme_extension.dart)
- Uses Material Design principles.
- Passed to the main `Chat` widget ([chat.dart](mdc:packages/flutter_chat_ui/lib/src/chat.dart)).
- Widgets should use theme values by default but allow overrides via parameters.
    - Good example: [simple_text_message.dart](mdc:packages/flutter_chat_ui/lib/src/simple_text_message.dart)

## 2. Builders (`Builders`)

- Allows replacing *any* UI component with a custom implementation.
- The `Builders` model is defined in [builders.dart](mdc:packages/flutter_chat_core/lib/src/models/builders.dart).
- Passed as a parameter to the `Chat` widget ([chat.dart](mdc:packages/flutter_chat_ui/lib/src/chat.dart)).
- Enables swapping out the composer, message bubbles, specific message types (text, image, etc.), date headers, status indicators, and more.
- Provides maximum flexibility for UI modifications.
