## Development Setup & Workflow

### Prerequisites

*   [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
*   [Melos](https://melos.invertase.dev/): Install via `dart pub global activate melos`

### Initial Setup

1.  Fork the repository on GitHub.
2.  Clone your fork locally: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/flutter_chat_ui.git`
3.  Navigate to the project directory: `cd flutter_chat_ui`
4.  Bootstrap the project using Melos (installs dependencies for all packages): `melos bootstrap` or `melos bs`

### Creating a New Example

1.  Navigate to the examples directory:
    ```bash
    cd examples
    ```
2.  Create the Flutter project:
    ```bash
    flutter create example_name --org chat.flyer
    ```
3.  Return to the root directory:
    ```bash
    cd ..
    ```
4.  Bootstrap Melos to link packages:
    ```bash
    melos bs
    ```
5.  Replace the content of `examples/example_name/analysis_options.yaml` with:
    ```yaml
    include: ../../analysis_options.yaml
    ```

### Creating a New Package

1.  Navigate to the packages directory:
    ```bash
    cd packages
    ```
2.  Create the Flutter package:
    ```bash
    flutter create --template=package package_name
    ```
3.  Return to the root directory:
    ```bash
    cd ..
    ```
4.  Bootstrap Melos:
    ```bash
    melos bs
    ```
5.  Replace the content of `packages/package_name/analysis_options.yaml` with:
    ```yaml
    include: ../../analysis_options.yaml
    ```
6.  Structure the package similarly to existing ones. Essential files include:
    ```
    lib/
      src/
        # Your Dart code
      package_name.dart # Exports
    analysis_options.yaml
    CHANGELOG.md
    LICENSE
    pubspec.yaml
    README.md
    ```
    Remove unnecessary generated files and update `pubspec.yaml`.
7.  Run `melos bs` again after modifying `pubspec.yaml`.

### Common Melos Commands

*   **Get/Link Dependencies:** `melos bootstrap` or `melos bs`
*   **Clean:** `melos clean` (removes build artifacts, pub caches, etc.)
*   **Run All Tests:** `melos test`
*   **Run Tests Selectively:** `melos run test:selective` (prompts for package selection)
*   **Generate Coverage:** `melos coverage`
*   **Generate Coverage Selectively:** `melos run coverage:selective`
*   **Analyze Code:** `melos analyze`
*   **Format Code:** `melos format`
*   **Apply Fixes:** `melos run fix`
*   **(flutter_chat_core) Build Runner:** `melos run build`

## Code Style

Please adhere to the code style defined in the root `analysis_options.yaml` file.

*   Run `melos format` to format your code before committing.
*   Run `melos analyze` to check for static analysis issues.

## Pull Request Process

1.  Ensure you have followed the [Development Setup](#development-setup--workflow).
2.  Create a new branch for your changes based on the `main` branch:
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main # Ensure you have the latest changes
    git checkout -b your-branch-name # e.g., fix/message-bug or feat/new-message-type
    ```
3.  Make your code changes.
4.  Add relevant tests for your changes.
5.  Run tests: `melos test`
6.  Format code and check analysis: `melos format && melos analyze`
7.  Commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message.
8.  Push your branch to your fork:
    ```bash
    git push origin your-branch-name
    ```
9.  Open a Pull Request (PR) from your fork's branch to the `flyerhq/flutter_chat_ui` `main` branch.
10. Provide a clear description of your PR, explaining the changes and linking to any relevant issues (e.g., `Fixes #123`).
